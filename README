This repo holds the lesson's from NeHe's OpenGL tutorials for Erlang:

http://nehe.gamedev.net/


You must have R13B and a working wx erlang library (which by default comes with R13B).
You can type in wx:new(). to see if it is working for you in the erlang shell.


Running the lessons:

erl
> GC = game_core:start_link().
> game_core:load(GC, lesson01).

Enjoy lesson 01...

> game_core:unload(GC)  % unloads currently loaded lesson
> game_core:load(GC, lesson02) % loads next lesson


An interesting thing to do is try to modify a currently loaded lesson's
source code draw method and compile it in the shell.  Initial attempts have shown
immediate updates with no crashing which can lead up to interactive programming... :)
